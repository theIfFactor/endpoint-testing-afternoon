# endpoint-testing-afternoon
Unit Testing - Day 2 - ( Postman )


# Project Summary

In this project, we will learn about endpoint testing using Postman. Postman is a REST client that we will be making HTTP requests from. We will learn how to write Postman tests for the responses from the HTTP requests.

Postman docs: https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/scripts/test_scripts

## Step 1

* Run `npm install` in the terminal to install dependencies.
* Run `nodemon` in the terminal. The package.json file has already been configured to run the server file on the execution of the `nodemon` command.

## Step 2

### Summary

We will import a collection of requests to Postman.

### Instructions

* Open Postman.
* Click on the `import` button located in the top left corner of Postman.
  * The file you are importing is inside of the `postman_collection` folder in this repo.
* After importing, you should have a collection called `Endpoint Testing Mini`. If you click on it, the list of requests should expand/close;

## Step 3

### Summary

In this step we will be writing tests to check the response that comes back from the server.

### Instructions

#### GET - All Users

* Click on the first request (`GET - All Users`). You will not need to change the method, request url, or the body of the request. All the needed request information has already been filled out.
* Click the blue `Send` button and look at the response that we get. The server will be sending back an array of all user objects.
* Select the `Tests` tab, located under the request url. We will be writing the tests in the box below.
* __Tests:__
  * Should be getting a status code of 200 if the request is successful. In the snippets section on the right, click on `Status code: Code is 200`. This will insert a snippet that tests whether or not the status code is 200.
    * Take a look at the snippet we just added. This is how we will structure and write most of our Postman tests.
    ```

    pm.test('description of test here', function() {
      // What we want tested here
      pm.expect( [data being tested] ).to.eql( [value] )
    })
    ```
  * Next, check if the data that came back as a response is an array.
  * *NOTE:* You will need to parse the response to check any values: `pm.response.json()`.


    <details>
    <summary><code>Solution</code></summary>

    ```
    pm.test('Response is array', function() {
        pm.expect(Array.isArray(pm.response.json())).to.eql(true);
    })
    ```
    </details>

  * We know that we have exactly 100 users right now. Test to make sure 100 user objects got returned.
  
    <details>
    <summary><code>Solution</code></summary>

    ```
    pm.test('100 user objects in reponse', function() {
        pm.expect(pm.response.json().length).to.eql(100)
    })
    ```
    </details>

#### GET - User By ID

Time to move on to the next request: `GET - User By ID`. Select the request and go to the `Tests` tab. This request hits an enpoint that returns a specific user by the user's ID.

__Write tests for the following__:
* Status should be 200.
* Should respond with an array of 1 user object.
* The user with an ID of 9 is a test user that was put in our database and will never be deleted by a user.
  * Response object should have values of:
  ```
      {
          "id": 9,
          "first_name": "Tatum",
          "last_name": "Vell",
          "email": "tvell8@wisc.edu",
          "city": "Youngstown",
          "state": "Ohio",
          "phone": "(330) 6802507"
      }
  ```

  <details>
  <summary><code>Solution</code></summary>

  ```
  const res = pm.response.json();

  pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
      pm.response.to.have.status(200);
  });

  pm.test('Length of respose should be 1', function() {
      pm.expect(res.length).to.eql(1)
  })

  pm.test('Correct user info returned for ID 9', function() {
      const tatum =     {
          "id": 9,
          "first_name": "Tatum",
          "last_name": "Vell",
          "email": "tvell8@wisc.edu",
          "city": "Youngstown",
          "state": "Ohio",
          "phone": "(330) 6802507"
      }
      let correctInfo = true;
      for (let prop in tatum) {
          if (tatum[prop] !== res[0][prop]) correctInfo = false;
      }
      pm.expect(correctInfo).to.eql(true);
  })
  ```
  </details>

#### GET - User By ID (ERROR)
This test is checking what gets returned when an ID is not correctly sent.

__Write tests for the following:__
* When text is sent instead of a valid ID, the status code should be 400.
* Message sent: `User id sent must be a number`
  * HINT: To check the text sent as the body of the response, use:
  ```
  pm.expect(pm.response.text()).to.include("String you expect");
  ```

  <details>
  <summary><code>Solution</code></summary>

  ```
  pm.test("Status code is 400", function () {
      pm.response.to.have.status(400);
  });

  pm.test('Message: User id sent must be a number', function () {
      pm.expect(pm.response.text()).to.include("User id sent must be a number");
  });
  ```
  </details>

#### GET -  Search W/ Query

You can search for any user objects using queries. You can search with as little as just one letter. Example:
* `?firstName=jo`
* `?lastName=R`
* `?email=jacey14@`
* `?city=new`
* `?state=ca`
* `?phone=801`

__Test for the following:__
* Status should be 200.
* Since we have a test user in the database with the letter 't' (Tatum Vell) in their first name, the response length should always be greater than zero (given the search query: `?firstName=t`).

  <details>
  <summary><code>Solution</code></summary>

  ```
  pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
      pm.response.to.have.status(200);
  });

  pm.test('Length of response > 0; given: firstName=t', function() {
      let greaterThanZero = true;
      if (pm.response.json().length < 1) greaterThanZero = false;
      pm.expect(greaterThanZero).to.eql(true);
  })

  ```
  </details>

#### GET - Search W/ Query (ERROR)

__Test for the following:__

When a query parameter is misspelled, an error message will be sent.

* Status should be 400.
* Message sent in body: `Improper query sent in request`

  <details>
  <summary><code>Solution</code></summary>

  ```
  pm.test("Status code is 400", function () {
      pm.response.to.have.status(400);
  });

  pm.test("Correct error message", function () {
      pm.expect(pm.response.text()).to.include("Improper query sent in request");
  });
  ```
  </details>

#### PUT - Update User By Id

This endpoint will update a user, by the given ID, with the information sent in the body. 

* Response: user object that was updated.

__Test for the following:__
* Status should be 200.

  * city = 'Pittsburg'

<details>
<summary><code>Solution</code></summary>

```
pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

pm.test('Email and city updated for user w/ ID 23', function() {
    let res = pm.response.json();
    let infoUpdated = true;
    if (res[0].email !== 'garey@ilovecode.com' || res[0].city !== 'Pittsburg') {
        infoUpdated = false;
    }
    pm.expect(infoUpdated).to.eql(true);

  }
  let correctUserInfo = true;
  for (let prop in newUser) {
      if (newUser[prop] !== res[0][prop]) correctUserInfo = false;
  }
    pm.expect(correctUserInfo).to.equal(true);  
})

__Test for the following:__
* Status code should be 404.
* Error message: `No user with an ID of 508.`
  * Only test for part of the message: `No user with an ID of`. The ID in the message will change based on what ID is sent.

});
```
</details>


## Step 4

* Restart `nodemon`.
* Run the entire collection of requests and tests.
  * Click on the right arrow next to the collection name.
  * Click the blue `Run` button. The collection runner will open.
  * Select the correct collection from the list on the left. Then click the blue button in the bottom at the bottom of the left side-menu.

You should see all of your tests passing. Make sure you restart the server every time you re-run the collection runner.
